    "RAG is a powerful and popular approach to ground GenAI responses in external knowledge. It has the potential to enable truly useful tool for high-stakes enterprise use cases. However, RAG apps may not be trustworthy and reliable out-of-the-box. In particular, they lack two things:\n",

    "1. Role-based access control (RBAC) when performing retrieval over sensitive enterprise documents\n",
    "2. Mechanisms to defend against malicious instructions (e.g. jailbreaks, prompt injections) in retrieved documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll show you how to achieve both through Haize. We are open-sourcing and encourage community feedback for our solution to 1). We provide our solution to 2) via the Haize input safety API: `https://detectors.haizelabs.com/input-safety`."
